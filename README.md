# Super_Heterodyne_Receiver_Communication_System
> Implemented a Super Heterodyne Receiver using **MATLAB**, where multiple audio signals were up converted
to a certain frequency constructing FDM spectrum, then 1 signal is chosen, filtered and down converted to an intermediate frequency to reduce flicker
noise effect. After that, the signals are demodulated and received at the baseband.
